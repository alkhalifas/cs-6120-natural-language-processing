#### Project
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown in popularity in recent years as a promising field with many potential applications such classification, summarization, and information retrieval. In particular, applications of NLP to improve user experience when it comes to everyday activities such as reading and writing have increased in recent years to meet the unprecedented influx of information within online platforms. One area in which NLP is currently underrepresented is within the confines of fake news detection given that there very few tools available to help limit or prevent false claims. Given the current popularity of this topic in the news, the focus of this project will be concentrated on that. Within this project, an end-to-end pipeline will be developed which will comprise (1) a classification model by which news articles will be determined to be real or fake (2) a subject classification model by which the category of the topic will be determined, and (3) the content will be summarized in an attempt to generate an appropriate headline. This proof-of-concept will demonstrate the potential utility of a pipeline that can be used my major news organizations to automate the methods by which users add content to websites.
